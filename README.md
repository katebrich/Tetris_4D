# Tetris 4D

## The game
Tetris 4Directions is my version of Tetris - the only little difference is that the tiles "fall" from all 4 directions!  
Your task is to arrange the tiles around the middle square, possibly without gaps. In classical Tetris, when a solid horizontal line is created, it disappears and the tiles move down one space; here, it is more challenging - a whole square (only perimeter, not inside) must be filled to make the other squares collapse in the middle - and get more points!
Check out the Controls to see the keyboard settings.  
It is also possible to save your progress and load the game later.  
## Installation
No installation needed - simply run the Release/Tetris4D.exe file.  

## Notes
This game was created as a semestral programming project in the second year of my Bachelors studies. I didn't know much about programming principles back then - the code would need much refactoring. I hope I get back to it some day.

The documentation is unfortunatelly available only in Czech, but the comments in code should help a lot.
